Reflection

After a lot of trail and error I managed to complete the requirements. I haven't redirected users to the posts page when submitting a post as the form is already on the posts page and updates when it is submitted. I do have it when a user is not logged in they are redirected back to the home page and when they click log out they are of course redirected back to the home page.

As we were using next.js this week i checked to see about using Axios again and from some reddit posts and some comparison articles, i found it was best to use the built-in fetch and route handlers. 
I tried to use bcrypt after briefly reading about it for my last assignment and also use json web tokens, but this caused a lot of problems. after a long day of trying to solve the issues and having a near melt down, i had to give up on the idea. However, if you are intrested in JWT i did find some good information at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31309759/what-is-secret-key-for-jwt-based-authentication-and-how-to-generate-it you can also find a good site for generating passwords.

A lot of my resources came from the building your application and API reference docs in nextjs.org. 
Mdn web docs had some useful information on Fetch API https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API.
A good resource for comparing data fetching methods: https://www.getfishtank.com/insights/comprehensive-guide-to-data-fetching-in-nextjs.

Unfortunately i still haven't got around to implementing the like feature for posts and adding notoriety points for users to go up ranks in levels. So i have put the leaderboard section on hold this time.

i ran into a lot of errors this week but managed to fix them and gained a higher appreciation for the ai in the Developers tool console. it does help with understanding the problems and gives possible solutions. that came in very handy this week.
i also got the chance to play with tailwind css and i have started to really like it, as you can directly put in the css styles, the lines do get a bit long though.

i'm hoping after this chaotic week, things will get a bit easier.

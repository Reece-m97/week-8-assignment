Reflection

This week’s assignment was both challenging and rewarding. Through trial and error, I managed to meet the requirements. While I haven't implemented redirection to the posts page after submitting a post, as the form is already on the posts page and updates dynamically. I also ensured users who are not logged in are redirected to the home page, and clicking the logout button successfully clears the session and returns them to the home page.

As this assignment focused on Next.js, I explored using Axios but ultimately decided on the built-in fetch function and route handlers, based on recommendations from resources like Reddit and comparison articles. While I initially attempted to integrate bcrypt for password hashing and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, I faced several issues during implementation. After extensive troubleshooting, I decided to postpone using both but found some excellent resources for future reference, including a Stack Overflow thread (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31309759/what-is-secret-key-for-jwt-based-authentication-and-how-to-generate-it) and within the answers you can find a good site for generating secure passwords.

Many of my resources came from the Next.js documentation, which was invaluable for building my application and APIs. Additionally, the MDN Web Docs provided clear guidance on the Fetch API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API), and I found a comparison guide to data-fetching methods (https://www.getfishtank.com/insights/comprehensive-guide-to-data-fetching-in-nextjs).

Unfortunately, I didn't get to implement the like feature for posts or the leaderboard functionality, which would have allowed users to gain notoriety points and advance in ranks. For now, I’ve put these features on hold, but I hope to revisit them soon.

Throughout this process, I encountered numerous errors but gained a newfound appreciation for the AI-powered suggestions in the Developer Tools console. These insights often helped me troubleshoot effectively. I also experimented with Tailwind CSS for the first time and enjoyed how it allowed me to style components directly in the markup, despite the longer class names.

In summary, this assignment was a chaotic yet rewarding experience. I’m proud of what I accomplished despite the setbacks and am excited to revisit unfinished features in the future. With the lessons learned, I hope the coming weeks will feel a bit more manageable!
